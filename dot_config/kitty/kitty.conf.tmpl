# The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the window

# Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab with at least this
# number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g. clicking the window
# close button or pressing the operating system shortcut to close windows) or by
# the close_tab action. A value of zero disables confirmation. This confirmation
# also applies to requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via
# the quit action). Negative values are converted to positive ones, however,
# with shell_integration enabled, using negative values means windows sitting at
# a shell prompt are not counted, only windows where some command is currently
# running. Note that if you want confirmation when closing individual windows,
# you can map the close_window_with_confirmation action.
